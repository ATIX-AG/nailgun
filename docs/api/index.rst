API Documentation
=================

This is the NailGun API documentation. It is mostly auto generated from the
source code. A good place to start reading is :doc:`nailgun`.

The :mod:`nailgun` namespace is the public API. The :mod:`tests` is not part of
the public API, and it is documented here for easy reference for developers.
